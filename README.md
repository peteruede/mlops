## Model Versions:
- **Model v1**: Used a single feature (`x1`) to predict `y`.  
- **Model v2**: Improved by using two features (`x1` and `x2`).  

### Performance Comparison:
- **Model v1**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) = 105.518 
- **Model v2**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) = 72.774  
- Model v2 performs better.  

## Running the Models:
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
